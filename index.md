## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

- Lab 7 was one of my favorite labs because it taught me how important defensive programming is in real-world software. I liked that we worked with command line input and had to validate everything before the program could run properly. It also helped me practice writing compound Boolean expressions, which made my code more precise and logical. One major thing I learned was how to catch errors early and print useful messages instead of letting a program crash. I also learned how to use make to build a program instead of manually compiling with clang++, which made me feel more like a real developer. Overall, Lab 7 made me more confident using git, working with a partner, and pushing code frequently while following a professional workflow.

Lab 9 was a favorite because it introduced file input and output, which made programming feel more real. I liked learning how to read data from a file and write results to another file, instead of just printing everything to the screen. This lab also showed me why error handling matters, since files might not exist or might fail to open properly. I used references about C++ programming and Linux-based operating systems to understand new functions and commands. Overall, this lab taught me how to store and manage data in a way that feels practical and useful.

Lab 11 was one of my favorites because it introduced object-oriented programming in a hands-on way. I learned how to write member function definitions for classes, which helped me understand how data and behavior are organized together in C++. I also liked working with random number generation because it made the programs feel dynamic and different every time they ran. Another useful part of this lab was automated unit testing, seeing tests pass or fail immediately showed whether my code actually worked as expected. Overall, this lab made me feel more confident with OOP structure, debugging, and writing cleaner, testable code.
