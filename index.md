## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7 

    This was one of my favorite labs because it taught me the importance of defensive programming in real-world software. I enjoyed working with command-line input and validating all inputs before the program could run properly. I also practiced writing compound Boolean expressions, which made my code more precise and logical. A major learning objective I realized was how to catch errors early and display helpful messages instead of letting a program crash. Additionally, I learned to use make to build programs instead of manually compiling with clang++, which made me feel more like a professional developer. Overall, Lab 7 increased my confidence in using Git, collaborating with a partner, and pushing code frequently while following a professional workflow.

* Lab 9 

    I particularly liked this lab because it introduced file input and output, which made programming feel more practical. I enjoyed learning how to read data from a file and write results to another file, instead of only printing to the screen. This lab emphasized the importance of error handling, since files might not exist or fail to open properly. A key learning objective I achieved was understanding how to store and manage data in a practical way. I also used references on C++ programming and Linux-based operating systems to explore new functions and commands, which enhanced my technical skills. Overall, Lab 9 made programming feel more real and applicable.

* Lab 11 

    This lab was a favorite because it introduced object-oriented programming in a hands-on way. I learned how to write member function definitions for classes, helping me understand how data and behavior are organized together in C++. I enjoyed implementing random number generation because it made programs feel dynamic and different each time they ran. Automated unit testing was another highlight; seeing tests pass or fail immediately showed whether my code worked as expected. The key learning objective I realized was gaining confidence in OOP structure, debugging, and writing cleaner, testable code. Overall, Lab 11 strengthened my understanding of professional programming practices.
